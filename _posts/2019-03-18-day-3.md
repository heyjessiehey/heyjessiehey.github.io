- creating sever and test it using locallhost port 5000

```
mkdir server.js
```
```
npm i -g nodemon // to run server.js
```
**nodemon**
Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. Perfect for development. Install it using npm.
Just use nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes. 

**express**
- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- APIs
With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.
- Performance
Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.


**bodyParser**
- Node.js body parsing middleware.
- Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
- As req.body's shape is based on user-controlled input, all properties and values in this object are untrusted and should be validated before trusting. For example, req.body.foo.toString() may fail in multiple ways, for example the foo property may not be there or may not be a string, and toString may not be a function and instead a string or other user input.
