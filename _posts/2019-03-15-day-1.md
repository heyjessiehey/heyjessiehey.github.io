developing client management system using react.js 
- used @material-ui/core
  - Table
  - withStyles
  
Java
- edited Workshop 7 
  - funtional interface's name should be generous
    ```java
    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Area { //ShpaeProperty name is better than Area
      double calArea(double ... d); //varargs
    }
    ```
  - failed to use Arbitrary Number of Arguments within an abstract method in a functional interface
    - [oracle doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/arguments.html#varargs)
    - the problem was incomparable parameter types in lambda 
      first type: double
      second type: double[]
    ```java
    private Area area = (r1, r2) -> Math.PI * r1 * r2;
    // operator * cannot be applied to double, double[]
    ```
